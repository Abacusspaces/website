      <h1>Legal Note on RERA Applicability</h1>
      
      <p>
        At <strong>Abacus Spaces</strong>, we specialize in the leasing of commercial office and retail properties.
        We do not sell or develop properties and therefore, <strong>RERA registration is not applicable to our operations.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>üìú What is RERA?</h2>
      
      <p>
        The <strong>Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA)</strong> was enacted to regulate real estate development and sale transactions.
        It aims to protect buyers, bring transparency, and monitor developers.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Section 2(d):</strong> Defines "allottee" in the context of the sale of units (residential or commercial). Leasing is not included.</li>
        <li><strong>Section 2(zn):</strong> Defines "real estate project" as a project intended for sale of plots, apartments, or buildings.</li>
        <li><strong>Section 3:</strong> Requires registration only where a promoter intends to market, advertise, or sell real estate units.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Hence, standard leasing or renting is outside the scope of RERA.</strong></p>

      <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Key Judicial & Regulatory Clarifications</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tamil Nadu RERA Appellate Tribunal ‚Äì Marg Properties Case (2022):</strong> Stated that a long-term lease with an upfront lump sum payment was similar to a sale and required RERA compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Sale-like Long-Term Leases</strong> (e.g., 12+ years with upfront premium) ‚Üí May fall under RERA, depending on state interpretation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Since we <strong>exclusively facilitate leasing</strong> of commercial spaces, 
        Abacus Spaces is <strong>not required</strong> to hold a RERA registration number.
        This position is fully consistent with the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 
        and relevant state rulings.
      </p>

      <h2>üîí Transparency & Compliance</h2>
      
      <p>
        We maintain the <strong>highest standards of compliance and clarity</strong> in all our dealings. 
        This note has been provided to assure our clients such as corporates, landlords, and tenants 
        that our business model is in <strong>full legal alignment with RERA</strong> as of August 2025.
      </p>

      <h3>‚öñÔ∏è Disclaimer:</h3>
      <p>
        This note is intended for <strong>informational purposes only</strong> and does not constitute legal advice. 
        For specific transactions involving long-term or complex lease structures, 
        <strong>independent legal consultation is recommended.</strong>
